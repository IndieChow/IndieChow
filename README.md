## Hi, I am Indrayudh 👋
I am a Senior Computer Engineering Student at Purdue University, West Lafayette.

I am deeply involved in various projects through Purdue Electric Racing, Purdue SoCET, and SCALE, where I focus on PCB design, RTL Design, and RTL verification.

## Projects I have worked on :computer:

- **RISC-V Processor:**  
  Designed and implemented a dual-core RISC-V processor with a 5-stage pipeline, split L1 Data and Instruction Caches, MSI Cache Coherency protocol, and atomic operations support (LR/SC).  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Questasim, VSCode, System Verilog, FPGA Synthesis

- **Smart Home Calendar Full-Stack Development:**  
  Developed a full-stack system integrated with the Outlook API, NewDataIO, and OpenWeatherMap to map RAW API data into an image format for an ESP32-based device. The system features secure communication and token-based authentication.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, HTML, CSS  

- **UVM-PLIC:**  
  Hardware verification of a Platform Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) using UVM. Developed testbenches and verified functionality as part of Purdue SoCET and SCALE.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Questasim, VSCode, System Verilog  

- **ECE337_CDL:**  
  Hardware RTL design of an AHB Lite USB 1.0 protocol, developed through the Purdue ECE337 course.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Questasim, VSCode, System Verilog  

- **Ethernet_Shield:**  
  Designed a PCB for an Ethernet Shield as part of Purdue SoCET.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* KiCAD  

- **Charger_PCB:**  
  Designed a PCB for a charger circuit with Purdue Electric Racing.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Altium  

- **CAN-PCB:**  
  Designed a PCB for a Controller Area Network (CAN) with Purdue Electric Racing.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* Altium  

- **Drumbit Project:**  
  Designed and implemented an RTL-based music synthesizer on an FPGA through the Purdue ECE270 course.  
  *Tools/Technologies:* FPGA, VSCode, Verilog, Verilog-FPGA Simulator  

- **React Project:**  
  Developed a Pokémon Deck Builder using React as part of Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays.
